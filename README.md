## About Me

I'm a passionate Robotics and Digital Systems Engineering student at Monterrey Institute of Technology (ITESM), expected to graduate in 2025. I have a strong foundation in **Microcontrollers, IoT Implementation, Embedded Systems, Control Systems, Data Science, Computer Architecture, and Computational Intelligence**. I also had the opportunity to enhance my knowledge at MIT with a course on Cyborg Enhancements.
